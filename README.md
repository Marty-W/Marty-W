# Oh, hi there! ðŸ‘‹

## What's going on
 
Right now I am in the middle of a job search. So a few points about me: 
    - nowadays I write mainly in typescript and I prefer it over writing apps in pure JS 
    - the biggest portion of my work to date was on FE, but I don't mind venturing over to the BE 
    - you can reach out to me if you're interested in hiring me over email or DMs
